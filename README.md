# Hello everyone
My name is Franco Kees, and I am delighted to share a little about myself with all of you. I hold a degree in Art and Digital Design from the prestigious University of Salvador. However, my journey into the fascinating world of data science has been a transformative one. Motivated by a passion for creative problem-solving, I pursued this Data Science course to leverage the power of data in the most innovative and imaginative ways.

With my artistic background and analytical mindset, I seek to bridge the gap between art and science by using data as a canvas to paint meaningful insights and uncover hidden patterns. Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I have come to appreciate how data, like a blank canvas, holds boundless potential waiting to be unlocked and transformed into valuable solutions.

My ultimate goal is to apply the skills and knowledge gained from this Data Science course to tackle real-world challenges across various domains. By combining creativity and technical expertise, I aspire to make a positive impact and contribute to the advancement of cutting-edge solutions in our ever-evolving digital landscape.

# So, let's get started!
In this example, we will showcase my final project completed for IBM Data Science Developer course, where we will assume the role of an employee at Space X. Our task will be to determine the pricing for each launch by analyzing the existing databases.
